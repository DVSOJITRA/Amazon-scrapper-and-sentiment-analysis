Around 45 apps stay in memory the device still shows 1.5 Gb available ram and is very smooth.4) No memory card is available. However large memory phones are not required anymore due to better cloud storage and network speeds . 64 Gb is more than enough for normal user. However if you live in an area that does bot have good internet infrastructure you can opt for 128 or more.5) The device was launched in July 17 2019.

Antutu banchmark is one thing, user experience is another.2. 4000 MAh battery does not necessarily mean good backup if the OS is not optimized.3. Bloatwares are an underestimated pain, they are those mosquitoes that tease you in your face with their annoying humm, and when you cant remove them, the helplessness is torturous.4. Gone are the days when camera quality was directly proportional to camera Megapixel.5. Notification light is only useful when you can SEE that.6.

Battery backup is surprisingly good - lasts atleast 2 days with 8+ hours screen on in total (not tested with 4G, use Wifi 8 hours in total)3. Audio is good, hi-res audio performance is good.4. Speakers and mic are very good - very well pronounced5. Device does not heat up with demanding apps and while quick charging - This is good, it takes about 2 hrs for full charge from 1% to 100%Cons -1. Installing any screen protector will reduce the finger print sensors ability to quickly unlock (i had to delete profiles several times, other things that matter - sweaty hands, rough fingers all matter - The technology is still to evolve)2. Front Facing camera sucks, extremely poor image output - This is a big disappointment.3. Back cameras too suck big time, grainy and the software is buggy does heavy post processing. - Older versions of Mi phones had better back camera and far better optics4. Slow motion video is a joke !! 2 seconds only due to hardware limitation, workaround use 120 FPS for longer videos5. Screen flickers while browsing (very poor refresh rate, very prominent while browsing at max brightness)6. Body is prone to scratches, by design, you must either use provided back case or buy one outside7. MIUI sucks, dont install any upgrades, it slows the phone down.8. The pre-loaded apps are burned into the ROM, like music, app installer, mi pay and other junk (which eat up compute resources - there are no inbuilt options to disable or uninstall those) - remember you cannot add storage to your device.9. The light sensors are buggy in this phone, could be s/w glitch, it never saves your settings beyond a day, however the ambient sensors work fine and are pretty responsive.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I bought this phone in January 2020. In March, in 2 months, the display went blankI took the phone to the customer care centre at Kharagpur and my problems started from there. There was no engineer in the centre. So they sent the pics of my phone to some person who is sitting in some location. That person based on the pics sent to him made the decision that my phone has physical damage and cannot be covered under warranty. The damage they showed my was a very minor scratch on the body of the phone(not on display) and this scratch was there from February and my phone was working fine. They were not even ready to mention this thing on their work sheet. All they wrote was that \" Customer is not ready to pay\". I had to fight with them to make them write the details. Even then they could not write. Adding to that the customer service lady there was scolding me as I asked them to write these in details.After that I spoke to the MI customer care who does not listen but say my phone has physical damage and even Amazon, after following up with them for 20 days, says the same story again and again. This is by far the worst customer care experience I hadUpdate: I took it to another mi service centre and they repaired it for free , no questions asked. Which makes me all the more angrier . How can 2 service centers of the same company have such different opinions.\\n\\n',\n",

Quick charging and battery life is niceThings I didn't like1. Front camera, when I take selfies on Sunny day (outdoor) the face become reddish, whenever the camera detects face this happens2. When your hotspot is turned on and you're connected to a wireless Bluetooth headset you'll hear that the voice or music is breaking3. Screen refresh rate, when the reading mode or dark mode is turned on, the black contents on the screen leaves a fading/blurry trail while scrolling the screen4. Pixelated video on YouTube, when I minimize a YouTube video, then reopen YouTube to continue watching it, the video gets pixelated at the beginning (this happens sometimes)My personal opinion- for this budget the phone could be much better( buy realme x2 instead)\\n\\n\",\n",

No heating observed.Super fast charging.Cons-The display flickers horribly when you use the screen outdoors or in high brightness. It's clearly visible when you switch to apps in task manager. Everyone else is facing the same issue but nobody brings it forth.The notification light doesn't work.There's a rubber part coming out from the front earpiece which can't be removed. And affects the beauty of this phone. I don't think the internal components were arranged properly in the manufacturing facility.Images clicked from the Camera has a lot of noise when you zoom to see details. The software does heavy post processing which makes the photo distorted.The battery discharges fast when you use internet. Even tho all of my background apps are hibernated. Battery life can be better.Useless miui bloatware cannot be removed.I disabled the in built fingerprint sensor since it was not accurate after applying basic ultra clear screen protector. And was also consuming battery.But i dont feel like replacing it since the unit i got was only one left in stock when i ordered from the seller\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after using this device for 5 months. The battery life is just awesome. Even after rigorous gaming, one full charge gives you almost 36 how of battery life. The camera is really good. Get a hang of the settings and you can click some really cool pics.There is a strange issue regarding the on screen finger print scanner. The manufacturer says no need to use any screen guard for better functionality of the finger print scanner. But the thing is, if you don't have a screen guard, the screen gets a lot of scratches. And if you have a screen guard, the finger print scanner is slow to detect your finger print.No heating issues at all. Even after streaming movies for 8 hours, did not feel much of heat on the device.One other issue with the device is the network. When you dial a number, it takes a lot of time to connect. Initially I thought it was with the service provider. Then I tried same network sim in other phone and other sim in my device. Issue persists.Overall body build is very sturdy. Feels really good when you hold it in hand.Face unlock is really cool. Unlocks even if you are wearing a mask. But not when wearing helmet. Although a bit slow as the front camera needs to pop up to detect your face, but it is really good.Overall, it is indeed a good buy. But could have been much much better.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick.Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it.Chipset? It\\'s above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch.Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users.Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you\\'re good to go. Details will be flagship like.The battery it\\'s good as well and gaming it\\'s a \"just good\" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra)Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!Highly recommended for people who doesn\\'t want confusion on buying this price range...\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster ✔️Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️Self cleaning speaker✔️Wireless FM✔️P2i coating✔️USB C✔️Fast 18W charger in the box✔️Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.\\n\\n',\n",

At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.\\n\\n\",\n",

BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!!

       " \"\\n\\n  Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.\\n\\n\",\n",

So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch.Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users.Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you\\'re good to go. Details will be flagship like.The battery it\\'s good as well and gaming it\\'s a \"just good\" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra)Price?

       " \"\\n\\n  I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster ✔️Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️Self cleaning speaker✔️Wireless FM✔️P2i coating✔️USB C✔️Fast 18W charger in the box✔️Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.\\n\\n\",\n",

I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019.

       " \"\\n\\n  Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick.Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it.Chipset? It\\'s above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch.Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users.Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you\\'re good to go. Details will be flagship like.The battery it\\'s good as well and gaming it\\'s a \"just good\" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra)Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!Highly recommended for people who doesn\\'t want confusion on buying this price range...\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster ✔️Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️Self cleaning speaker✔️Wireless FM✔️P2i coating✔️USB C✔️Fast 18W charger in the box✔️Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick.Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it.Chipset? It\\'s above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch.Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users.Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you\\'re good to go. Details will be flagship like.The battery it\\'s good as well and gaming it\\'s a \"just good\" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra)Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!Highly recommended for people who doesn\\'t want confusion on buying this price range...\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster ✔️Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️Self cleaning speaker✔️Wireless FM✔️P2i coating✔️USB C✔️Fast 18W charger in the box✔️Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.\\n\\n',\n",

At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications:6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB |  64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: CameraThis is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there’s a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, batteryGames like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, DisplayThe Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Glad to be the first one to write a review for this phone! The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image.The Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images.It is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does!Actually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android!About the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won't help at all in any transfer of data.Please note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!All in all a good phone for first-time buyers (considering the camera specs and price point), but a clear NO for migration! Also if you don't want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy, check, decide and return then please note that it doesn't work!\\n\\n\",\n",

I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\\n\\n',\n",

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\\n\",\n",

Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\\n\\n',\n",

Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex\\n\\n',\n",

I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...\\n\\n\",\n",

No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.\\n\\n\",\n",

Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\\n\\n\",\n",

Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000\\n\\n\",\n",

I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\\n\\n',\n",

The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5.

Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit.

At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs.

The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been\\n\\n\",\n",

Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true.

Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.\\n\\n',\n",

Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3.

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3.

Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...\\n\\n\",\n",

When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive..

I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\\n\\n\"]"
